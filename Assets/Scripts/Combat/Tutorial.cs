        When in dangerous situations, sometimes combat is necessary. Leora can move using W, A, S, and D, but she can also attack using (key).
        Try attacking the training dummy now using (key).
        Additionally, Leora can use magic to deal damage to multiple enemies at once. Each type of magic also has an additional effect, with Light magic stunning enemies.
        Try casting Light magic using (key). Leora can gain different types of magic at a later date.
        Finally, Leora can also parry attacks, stunning the attacker and diminishing the damage dealt to her. This can be done using (key).
        Try parrying Severin now using (key). Time if perfectly to get a perfect parry!
