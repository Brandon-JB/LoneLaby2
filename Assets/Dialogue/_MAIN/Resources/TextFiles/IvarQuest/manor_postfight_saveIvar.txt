leora "And still, you refuse to relinquish the scepter?"
Highlight(ivar -o true)
ivar "No. You would have to pry it from my cold, dead hands. I know what I am, my dear, but I swear to you—once I have saved them, I will change. I will be better. I will be so noble, even the saints will envy me."

leora "...If you insist. Once your family is secure, you <i>must</i> contact the Order. Zaro needs the Scepter, but perhaps there is a way to rescue your family, punish their captors and return the Scepter."
leora "Even then, where are the knights that were sent to retrieve you? What became of them?"

Highlight(leora -o true)
leora "Yes, what became of them?"
Highlight(ivar -o true)
ivar "Ah, well... I am unsure. You are the only knight I have seen in a long while, Dame."

leora "(I am sure others were here... are Ivar's words truly to be trusted?)"
leora "Ivar, if you must possess the Scepter of Truth, could you at least store it away? You clutch it as if it will sprout wings and fly away."
Highlight(ivar -o true)
ivar "Ah... y-yes. A fair argument. Perhaps then... perhaps then the whispers will stop."
ivar "Regardless, I owe you my thanks, Dame. You have done a noble thing. Perhaps... this will suffice for showing my gratitude?"
