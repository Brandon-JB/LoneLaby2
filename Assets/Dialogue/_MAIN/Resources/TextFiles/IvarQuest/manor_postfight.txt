ivar "No! You can harm me however you wish, but know this—if you take the scepter, you condemn them."

leora "Did their captors name the scepter in their demands?"
Highlight(ivar -o true)
SetSprite(leora lookLeft)
ivar "They requested money, but a relic of immeasurable value? That carries weight. That buys time. The scepter itself means nothing to me—it is simply a means to an end."
Highlight(leora -o true)
SetSprite(leora confused)
leora "Yet if I let you go, what message does that send? That anyone may steal from the Order so long as they claim just cause?"
Highlight(ivar -o true)
SetSprite(ivar angry)
ivar "Would you condemn a starving man for stealing bread? Would you cut him down as you would a murderer?"
Highlight(leora -o true)
SetSprite(leora angryEyesClosed)
leora "This is no loaf of bread. The scepter is not mere gold nor it is merely a tool for the Order's rituals, it can heal incurable wounds."
SetSprite(leora angry)
leora "However, because of it's power and strain on the user, it is reserved for the Speaker of Truth exclusively. Without the scepter, the Order cannot properly tend to the sick and wounded. They will perish."
Highlight(ivar -o true)
ivar "And what has the Order done to bring back my innocent wife? My innocent child? What will they do if I am hung for desperate thievery? You and I know the answer to both is nothing."
ivar "The Order does not bargain with thieves of any sort, including kidnappers. Eleanor is six and they would let her <i>die</i>."
SetSprite(leora lookRight)
ivar "I care nothing for Zaro, for its knights, its politics. I care for my people. My family."
SetSprite(ivar angry)
ivar "If you think me worthy of death for choosing them over others, then strike me down. Drag me to Zaro, where I will be hanged like the criminal you think me to be."
