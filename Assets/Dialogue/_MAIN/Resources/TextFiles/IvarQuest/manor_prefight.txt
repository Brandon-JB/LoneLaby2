leora "Ivar. You stand before Leora, servant of Verita. The Order summons you. You will relinquish the Scepter of Truth and return to Zaro for judgment."

ivar "W-what?! A knight? Here? Oh, dear lady, you must be terribly lost. I have done nothing to provoke such an... <i>abrupt</i> search of my home."
Highlight(leora -o true)
leora "You know well what I seek. The Scepter of Truth belongs to the Order. Knights sent to retrieve you have vanished—one can only assume the price you made them pay? You will find that I am much less fallible than the rest."
Highlight(ivar -o true)
SetSprite(ivar angry)
ivar "Dispose? My dear, do I look like the sort to dirty my hands with such barbarism?"
ivar "No, no, no. Ivar Damaris does not steal. He reallocates, borrows, repurposes—as any clever man does."
Highlight(leora -o true)
leora "The only thing you have done is take relief from the ill and invite ruin upon yourself."
Highlight(ivar -o true)
SetSprite(ivar lookLeft)
ivar "Oh, ruin found me long before I ever touched this wretched thing! You think this scepter is in my possession for sport? For greed? No, knight. My wife and daughter were taken. Ransomed."
SetSprite(ivar ivar)
ivar "Whoever took them assumed my coffers were endless-that I was drowning in gold. They did not know that I had... squandered my fortune. That I had nothing left but debts and disgrace."
SetSprite(ivar lookRight)
ivar "Oh, I was a fool. I admit it! I lived lavishly, indulged freely, turned my back on responsibility."
ivar "And now, when my family needed me most, I had nothing left to offer. So I stole from the one place that would not suffer from such a loss. The Order has everything—what is one little scepter to them?"
Highlight(leora -o true)
leora "You dare cloak yourself in righteousness? You would defile Verita's will to soothe your own failures?"
Highlight(ivar -o true)
SetSprite(ivar angry)
ivar "Verita's will? Ha! If this scepter truly held absolute truth, then tell me—why does it lie to me?"
SetSprite(ivar lookLeft)
ivar "It whispers, you know. Shows things I never wanted to see. It knows what I am. It knows what I've done. But it won't stop."
Highlight(leora -o true)
SetSprite(leora confused)
leora "You are unwell. The scepter is not yours to wield and you are breaking beneath its weight. Release it, Ivar. Before it consumes you."
Highlight(ivar -o true)
SetSprite(ivar angry)
ivar "No, no, no. You do not get to sound concerned, knight."
SetSprite(ivar crashout)
ivar "Your family isn't rotting in some cell. You don't wake up choking on the truth—that you could have stopped it. But no, I had to be clever. I had to play the game, had to open my mouth—"
SetSprite(ivar angry)
ivar "And now look at me! Do you know what it is to be nothing? To lose everything and be left with... this?"
SetSprite(ivar crashout)
ivar "Just go. Let me fix this. Let me—just let me do this!"
