verita "<b>Dost thou truly believe thy heart strayed from justice? Or hath justice merely taken an unexpected form?</b>"
verita "<b>Thou dost not disobey out of malice, but because the road ahead is treacherous. No longer dost thou see only black and white, only guilt and innocence. Thou seest the spaces between.</b>"
verita "<b>To condemn a thief is easy. But know this, Child of Light—no one steals for the joy of it. They steal from desperation, from need.</b>"
