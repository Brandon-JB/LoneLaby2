leora "Certainly. What do you require?"
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "I have a theory regarding the kidnappings, but I am bound to my duties here. A student of mine recently spoke of figures lurking in the Veinwood-ones that could vanish and reappear in an instant, pulling travelers into their frostbitten grasp."
sophie "It sounded to me like the work of spirits. I am no expert on the undead, but if a particularly powerful one exists, it could explain how people are disappearing without a trace."
sophie "Yet... why would spirits take people at all?"
sophie "Perhaps I am overthinking. If this leads nowhere, then forget my ramblings, Dame-it is only a thought."
Highlight(leora -o true)
leora "I find ramblings quite useful, actually. And this is more than that-it is a lead."
leora "I will search the Veinwood and see what I uncover."
Highlight(sophie -o true)
sophie "Splendid. Let me know what you find, should it be of interest."
