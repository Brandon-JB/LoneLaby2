kisa "Oh, where to go first? Zaro is such a bustling city! So much to do, so little time..."
SetSprite(kisa happy)
kisa "Excuse me, madam! You're a knight, are you not? Surely you've had your fair share of grand adventures! Strangled dragons with only your gauntlets? Heard every tale in these lands?"

leora "I assure you, life as a knight is not quite that adventurous. There are occasional quests, yes, but most of my duties are carried out in or around Zaro."
SetSprite(leora smile)
leora "Why do you ask? Are you seeking a quest?"
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "Why... yes! I would love to go on a quest! Any quest will do! I promise I will live up to your expectations!"
Highlight(leora -o true)
SetSprite(leora confused)
leora "I'm afraid I don't have a quest to give you. In fact, I have one of my own that I should be tending to."

leora "Do not fret, friend. A quest will come to you in time. You could always travel for the sake of explorationâ€”many knights venture to Isen's eastern peninsula purely for the experience."

kisa "That sounds lovely! So... how does one do that? Just... go? Leave? Pace around the area and return?"
Highlight(leora -o true)
SetSprite(leora confused)
leora "... No, there is more to it than that."
leora "How about this? I must travel there for my quest regardless. I can scout the landscape and let you know if it is worth your time."
leora "I am certain I will encounter monsters along the way-I can gauge their strength to ensure you are... adequately prepared. Does that sound fair?"
Highlight(kisa -o true)
SetSprite(kisa happy)
kisa "Do not worry, madam, for I can tackle any threat! ... But that would be appreciated."
