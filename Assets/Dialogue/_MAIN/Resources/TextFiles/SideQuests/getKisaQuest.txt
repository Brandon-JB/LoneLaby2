kisa "Oh, where to go first? Zaro is such a bustling city! So much to do, so little time..."
kisa "Excuse me, madam! You're a knight, are you not? Surely you've had your fair share of grand adventures! Strangled dragons with only your gauntlets? Heard every tale in these lands?"

leora "I assure you, life as a knight is not quite that adventurous. There are occasional quests, yes, but most of my duties are carried out in or around Zaro."
leora "Why do you ask? Are you seeking a quest?"
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "Why... yes! I would love to go on a quest! Any quest will do! I promise I will live up to your expectations!"
Highlight(leora -o true)
leora "I'm afraid I don't have a quest to give you. In fact, I have one of my own that I should be tending to."

kisa "Ah. ... Curses! How is a bard supposed to start her life's story if her life is not noteworthy! Father had already defeated a beholder at my age... "
Highlight(leora -o true)
leora "Do not fret, friend. A quest will come to you in time. You could always travel for the sake of exploration-many knights venture to Isen's eastern peninsula purely for the experience."
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "That sounds lovely! So... how does one do that? Just... go? Leave? Pace around the area and return?"
Highlight(leora -o true)
leora "... No, there is more to it than that."
leora "How about this? I must travel there for my quest regardless. I can scout the landscape and let you know if it is worth your time."
leora "I am certain I will encounter monsters along the way-I can gauge their strength to ensure you are... adequately prepared. Does that sound fair?"
Highlight(kisa -o true)
kisa "Do not worry, madam, for I can tackle any threat! ... But that would be appreciated."
