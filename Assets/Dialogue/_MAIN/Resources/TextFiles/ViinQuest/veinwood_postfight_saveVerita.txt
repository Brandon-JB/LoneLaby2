leora "(In what matter?)"
Highlight(verita -o true)
verita "<b>Justice is not concrete, though the Order claims otherwise. A poor man's morality differs from that of a noble. A child's differs from an elder's. And yet—each believes themselves righteous.</b>"
verita "<b>Had another been given this task, they may have chosen differently. They may have justified Viin's death, believing the risk outweighed the mercy. They would call it justice, and so too wouldst thou call thine own choice the same.</b>"
verita "<b>No longer dost thou follow orders blindly. Thou hast reasoned, weighed the burden of thy choice. That is admirable. That is what My teachings seek to instill in My followers.</b>"
verita "<b>The Order, for all its worship, fears this. They fear a mind that questions, that seeks truth beyond what is given.</b>"
verita "<b>For thy growth, I grant thee My blessing. Not freely, but as a reward for thy wisdom. Thy understanding of justice hath deepened, and so too shall thy strength.</b>"

leora "(I... T-thank you, Verita. This blessing means more than I can express.)"
leora "(And yet... I still fear. Viin will kill again. Will I be to blame? Will their souls haunt me?)"
Highlight(verita -o true)
verita "<b>Child of the Light... that, I cannot answer. But know this—in sparing Viin, thou hast also saved Vaang.</b>"
verita "<b>Their fates are balanced, like two weights upon a scale. Viin takes life, yet Vaang nurtures it. This is why thou didst choose mercy, is it not?</b>"
verita "<b>Go now, Justiciar of Light. Though bound by the Order's oath, let not thy mind be bound with it.</b>"
