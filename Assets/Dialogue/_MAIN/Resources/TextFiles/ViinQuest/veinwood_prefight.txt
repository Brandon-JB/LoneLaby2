viin "Ooooh, so <i>fierce</i>. You must be a Justiciar. "
viin "I've killed a few of your kind. But it's always a delight to watch you strut in, all righteous fury and gleaming armor, thinking you're the hero of this little tale."
viin "But tell me, knight—where were you when people starved? When they froze in the streets while you feasted in your grand halls?"
viin "Oh, you act fast enough when a hungry child dares steal from your reserves. But all that food, all those warm beds—you've earned them, haven't you? By condemning people like us."
viin "But wait! You have a <i>god</i> backing your Order, which makes you <i>right</i>, doesn't it?"

viin "Ha, struck a nerve, I see? I love the look of rage in a knight's eyes before I carve them out. And yours are so pretty, too... don't worry, I'll put them to good use."
