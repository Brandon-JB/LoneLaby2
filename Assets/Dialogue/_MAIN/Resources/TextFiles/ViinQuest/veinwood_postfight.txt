SetSprite(viin mocking)
viin "Hahaha! Oh, is it still not clear? We are soulbound. I tried to fuse our souls—to become one. Viin and Vaang, no longer two, but Tao."

viin "But it went awry. Now, when I wound, he feels it beneath his skin. When he hungers, I cannot be satiated. And if I were to die?"
Highlight(leora -o true)
leora "No... he-... he is innocent. He is nothing like you."
Highlight(viin -o true)
viin "Spare me the sermon, Justiciar. I don't care what you think of me. All you need to know is this—if I fall, so does Vaang. That sweet, self-sacrificing fool you all adore? Gone."
SetSprite(viin mocking)
viin "Sure, the Order could absorb the orphanage. But I've seen Vaang. He gives everything to those children. They're his. He's their father in all but name. And if he dies, those kids will be left with nothing. Again."

viin "But if I go, so does innocent little Vaang. I know you can't do it. The Order would strike me down the instant I walk through those doors, you know this well. So go ahead, <i>Dame</i>. Make your choice."
