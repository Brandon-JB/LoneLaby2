lucan "But one mistake—one moment of defiance—and I was cast aside. They would rather see me dead than acknowledge their own folly. My oath? I care nothing for it. I did what was right."
lucan "That is the difference between us, Justiciar. I follow what is right—you follow what you are told."
lucan "What happens when the Order commands you to take an innocent life? Will you obey without question?"
Highlight(leora -o true)
