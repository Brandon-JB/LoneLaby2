lucan "...I was like you once. A loyal hound, eager to serve. I knew the Order's game and played my part."
lucan "But one mistake—one moment of defiance—and I was cast aside. They would rather see me dead than acknowledge their own folly. My oath? I care nothing for it. I did what was right."
lucan "That is the difference between us, Justiciar. I follow what is right—you follow what you are told."
lucan "What happens when the Order commands you to take an innocent life? Will you obey without question?"

lucan "Similar cases broke out in my days under the oath. It is an obedience test-- a ploy they pull when they wish for their enemy's quick demise. Capture a few people from the slums, wrongfully accuse someone they don't like, and wait for their justiciars to carry out their orders. This is a ruse, Dame."
