lucan "A Justiciar, sent for a withering old soldier? My, how the Order must be <i>overflowing</i> with knights to spare."
lucan "Years have passed since last they sought me... Tell me, what crime do they lay at my feet this time?"
Highlight(leora -o true)
leora "You know it well. You abandoned your post at Grest, condemned hundreds to die in your stead. And now you steal away the innocents of Zaro to twist them to your cause. Do you deny it?"
Highlight(lucan -o true)
lucan "Do I deny it? Would that make a difference to the Order if I did?"
Highlight(leora -o true)
leora "So you do not."

lucan "I did not abandon my post. I saw the enemy upon the horizon, knew the city could not be held. I chose to evacuate, but I was too late. When the slaughter began, only my men and I escaped with our lives. I saved what I could."
lucan "The truth of that day is a bitter thing, but I do not shrink from it. I did not flee out of fear, knight—I fled because I saw the Order for what it is. They would see soldiers die for the illusion of honor, even when no battle could be won."
lucan "You must see it—see the <i>truth</i>. The Order bends Verita's word to suit their desires, to justify their hands drenched in innocent blood."
Highlight(leora -o true)
leora "I have heard <b>enough</b>. You seek only to stall, and I have my orders."
Highlight(lucan -o true)
lucan "No. To return to the Order is to walk to my own execution. You know this well. Those sent for judgment do not return. I will not return to Zaro."
Highlight(leora -o true)
leora "So be it. I had hoped to settle this without bloodshed, but you leave me no choice."
