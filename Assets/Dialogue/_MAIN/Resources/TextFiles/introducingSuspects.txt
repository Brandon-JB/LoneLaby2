speaker "First is Lucan, the Oathbreaker. You recall the tragedy of Grest… a city that might yet stand, had this man not turned his back upon it by commanding his regiment to flee. Hundreds died in his absence."
speaker "We now suspect him of plucking innocents from the streets, forcing them to join his outcasts. He must be brought to justice."

speaker "Next is Ivar, a noble from the east. He departed from Zaro the day the Scepter of Truth was stolen from its pedestal. Knights were sent to retrieve him—none have returned."
speaker "The Scepter, as you know, can heal the sick of otherwise incurable illness. However, it can only be wielded by the most pious of user, or it will corrupt their mind. Ivar will succumb quickly. Time is of the essence."

speaker "Last is Viin, butcher of knights. You have heard the name, I am certain."
speaker "Her heresy goes beyond bloodshed, however—she seeks create unholy fusions of soul and flesh, in defiance of both life and order. It is an affront to Verita’s law."

speaker "Each suspect must be brought before the Order for their judgement. Their capture is your solemn duty."
speaker "Lucan is shrouded in the western mountains. Ivar lingers near his estate in the northeast. Vinn is cloaked in the Veinwood southeast of Zaro."
speaker "Retrieve them in any order you wish, though your mastery of the Light may serve you best against Lucan. Additionally, it would be wise to speak to Vaang–as Viin's twin, he knows her ways best."
speaker "Now go. Bring these sinners into Verita's light."
