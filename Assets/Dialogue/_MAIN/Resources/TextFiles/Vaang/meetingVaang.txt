vaang "A pleasure to meet you, Dame. Yes, I am Vaang. I assume you seek knowledge of Viin?"
Highlight(leora -o true)
leora "You are well-informed."
Highlight(vaang -o true)
SetSprite(vaang glance)
vaang "Experienced is the better word. The Order questions me often in pursuit of my sister."
SetSprite(vaang vaang)
vaang "Though, do not misunderstand me– I do not condone her actions. But I do not wish her harm either. She is still my sister."
vaang "But I suspect you did not come for sentiments. Ask what you will."
Highlight(leora -o true)
SetSprite(leora confused)
leora "You are aware of Viin's title—the Butcher of Knights. The Order believes I alone can best her and bring her to justice. However, I do not know if my skill will be enough."
leora "I do not relish fighting with an advantage, but given the circumstances, I think it wisest to ask if there is any edge I might bring to battle against her."
Highlight(vaang -o true)
SetSprite(vaang sad)
vaang "Oh my. The Order has sent many before you, yet none alone. They must see something in you... or they are desperate."
SetSprite(vaang vaang)
vaang "Either way, I agree it is wise to ask—Viin is unpredictable and lacks restraint. However her constitution, just like mine, is weak to psychic energy. It has been that way since we we're children."
Highlight(leora -o true)
leora "That is valuable knowledge. However, I lack the means to deal psychic damage."
Highlight(vaang -o true)
vaang "I believe you have an option—I have heard whispers of enchanted amulets, able to reshape the wearer's magic. You wield the Light, yes? An Amulet of the Mind could assist you."

SetSprite(leora leora)
leora "Interesting... I will seek one out. Thank you, Vaang."
leora "The Speaker claimed Viin is in the Veinwood, southeast of Zaro. Is that where I will find her?"
Highlight(vaang -o true)
SetSprite(vaang glance)
vaang "Yes. Across the bridge to the island. I have only been there once, and I have no desire to return."
SetSprite(vaang vaang)
vaang "Is there anything else you require?"
Highlight(leora -o true)
SetSprite(leora smile)
leora "Not at the moment. Thank you, Vaang. You have been more helpful than you know."
